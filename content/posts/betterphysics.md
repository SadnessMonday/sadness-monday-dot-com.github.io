# Announcing BetterPhysics

Hello fellow Unity developers!

Sadness Monday is pleased to announce BetterPhysics, our new physics asset coming soon in the Unity Asset store!

BetterPhysics builds upon Unity's base Physics engine and makes it possible to quickly and easily create complex physics interactions with less code!

Get it when it drops at the [Unity Asset Store](https://u3d.as/308k)
