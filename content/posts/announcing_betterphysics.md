Hello fellow Unity developers!

Sadness Monday is pleased to announce BetterPhysics, our new physics asset coming soon in the Unity Asset store!

{{< youtube OxtKnApa6q8 >}}

BetterPhysics builds upon Unity's base Physics engine and makes it possible to quickly and easily create complex physics interactions with less code!

Get it when it drops at the [Unity Asset Store](https://u3d.as/308k)

See the documentation at [BetterPhysics Documentation]({{< ref "/pages/betterphysics/index.md" >}} "BetterPhysics Documentation")
